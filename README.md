The Stochastic Pi Machine (SPiM) is a programming language developed by Microsoft Research for designing and simulating computer models of biological processes. The language is based on a mathematical formalism known as the pi-calculus, and the simulation algorithm is based on standard kinetic theory of physical chemistry.


A SPiM program consists of one or more declarations, together with optional top-level directives for sampling and plotting simulation results.
