**A SPiM program (*.spi) which simulates the behaviour of the neural network, i.e. the avoidance reflex circuit of C. elegans**

The Stochastic Pi Machine (SPiM) is a programming language developed by Microsoft Research for designing and simulating computer models of biological processes. The language is based on a mathematical formalism known as the pi-calculus, and the simulation algorithm is based on standard kinetic theory of physical chemistry. 

The SPiM program (*.spi) which simulates the behaviour of the neural network, i.e. the avoidance reflex circuit of C. elegans, can be found in this repository, see "FFL of C.elegans SPIM model Markus Karjalainen.spi"
